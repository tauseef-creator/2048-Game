# 2048 Game in C++

This is a terminal-based implementation of the classic 2048 game, written in C++. The project recreates the core mechanics of the popular puzzle game, where players combine tiles with numbers (powers of 2) by sliding them across a 4x4 grid using arrow keys or WASD controls. The goal is to achieve the elusive 2048 tileâ€”or go as far as possible before the grid fills up.


## Build and Run

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++ for Linux or MinGW for Windows).
- Terminal/console access.

### Instructions
- Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/2048-game.git
cd 2048-game
```

- Compile the code:
```
g++ 2048.cpp -o 2048
```

- Run the game:
```
./2048    # Linux
2048.exe  # Windows
```

## Controls
- WASD: Move tiles up (W), left (A), down (S), right (D).
